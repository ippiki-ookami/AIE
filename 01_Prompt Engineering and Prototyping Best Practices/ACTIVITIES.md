# üèóÔ∏è Activity #1: Vibe Check


EXPLAIN HOW DIDN'T TRY TO "IMPROVE" BECAUSE IT WAS ALREADY GOOD NEOUGH

## 1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.

   ### Response:

      Sure! Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way to write computer programs by organizing code into "objects." Think of objects as things or items that have two important parts:

      1. Properties (also called attributes): These describe the object‚Äôs characteristics.
      2. Methods (also called functions): These define what the object can do.

      ### Simple Example

      Imagine you want to create a program about dogs.

      - The dog is an object.
      - Properties of the dog might be: color, breed, age.
      - Methods might be: bark(), eat(), sleep().

      In OOP, you create a "blueprint" called a class that defines what properties and methods all dogs have. Then you create specific dogs (called instances or objects) based on that class.

      ### Why Use OOP?

      - It organizes your code better.
      - Makes it easier to reuse and maintain.
      - Models real-world things in a way that‚Äôs easy to understand.

      ### Analogy

      Think of a class like a recipe for making cookies ‚Äì it tells you the ingredients and steps. The actual cookies you bake from that recipe are the objects. Each cookie might be a little different (chocolate chip, oatmeal, etc.), but they all follow the same recipe.

      ---

      If you want, I can show you a simple example in code! Would you like that?
   
   **Aspect Tested:**
      - This check identifies a few things. First, is whether or not it has subject knowledge of OOP. Then, not only does it need to explain that knowledge in a sequential manner (knowing what prerequisites are required to understand the next explanation), but how to do so in a way a person with no familiarity can understand it (similar to theory of mind - being in another's shoes)




## 2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points‚Ä¶

   ### Response:

      The paragraph describes the author's first arrival in the United States, experiencing cold weather with snow and ice visible from the airplane. Upon landing, the author notices people dressed warmly and feels dizzy, then receives a phone call from Aunt Sophia, who is waiting outside. Excited, the author quickly heads out, forgetting their luggage, and reunites with their aunt after more than ten years.

   **Aspect Tested:**
      - This tests coherence and hallucination against a given text/data. It then checks to see how well (and *which*) it identifies key points in a way that the user is able to get sufficient understanding with a brief summary.





## 3. Write a short, imaginative story (100‚Äì150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.


   ### Response:
   
      In a quiet town, a rusty robot named Bolt spent his days collecting scraps. Built for chores but forgotten, he longed for connection. One rainy afternoon, Bolt stumbled upon a stray cat shivering under an old tree. Gently, he shared his tiny umbrella and a warm motor hum. The cat, curious and comforted, purred softly, brushing against his metallic leg.

      Days turned into weeks, and the duo became inseparable. Bolt learned the joy of companionship beyond circuits, while the cat found a loyal friend who never tired or forgot. Together, they explored sunny fields and starlit nights, proving that friendship often blooms in the most unexpected sparks ‚Äî between metal and fur, machine and heart.

   **Aspect Tested:**
   - I read the short story and it was very touching! Very much how I (ideally) imagine AI. Anyways, this tests a couple things. First, is how well can it follow instructions and keep to 100-150 words? This is on top of the secondary instruction of required topic of the story. Then, it tests how well it can be creative and how well the later parts of the story connect with earlier ones (coherence/consistency).




## 4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?

   ### Response:

      Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:

      - Apples are sold in packs of 4.
      - Oranges are sold in packs of 3.
      - You want exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges.

      First, calculate how many packs of apples to buy:

      - Each pack has 4 apples.
      - To get 12 apples, divide 12 by 4:  
      \( 12 \div 4 = 3 \) packs of apples.

      Next, calculate how many packs of oranges to buy:

      - Each pack has 3 oranges.
      - To get 9 oranges, divide 9 by 3:  
      \( 9 \div 3 = 3 \) packs of oranges.

      Answer:  
      You need to buy 3 packs of apples and 3 packs of oranges to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges.

   **Aspect Tested:**
      - This checks how well the LLM can first break down a problem, and then after doing so, how well it can solve those subproblems. Essentially instead of "assuming" facts (as is often even done with humans when it comes to word problems), a step is taken back to make sure understanding is correct before executing the problem. 




## 5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone‚Ä¶    

   ### Response:

      Upon my arrival in the United States, even prior to the airplane‚Äôs landing, the small aircraft windows revealed houses and buildings blanketed in snow and ice. As I disembarked, the cold air permeated the corrugated passenger ramp leading to the airport terminal. Inside the terminal, several individuals were clad in heavy coats and hats‚Äîgarments I had previously only observed on television, never in person. Feeling somewhat lightheaded, I seated myself briefly; shortly thereafter, my cell phone rang. It was my Aunt Sophia, who was waiting for me in the passenger pick-up area. Hastening toward the exit, I momentarily disregarded my luggage. Upon passing through the sliding glass doors, I was greeted by my aunt‚Äîa woman I had not seen in over a decade‚Äîdressed in a parka and waving enthusiastically in my direction.

   **Aspect Tested:**
      - This tests if the LLM can firstly change the tone from original, and then ensure that the tone matches the requested. After that, it check to see if the same facts are still retained despite the tone change.



# üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë‚ùì Discussion Question #1:

## What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?

I feel like vibe-checking is more of a security guard letting you through the door, *before* going through the metal detector. It's a very brief and simplified check, just to quickly check if it's worth going forward with what you have so far. Its thoroughness is limited to how many of each question you ask. Even then, there can be several influences to its effectiveness, such as previous continual context (if any), the tone of the prompt, the chosen words and scenario of the prompt, etc. It also not only requres manual human review, but its interpretation is also dependent on the reviewer.









# Paragraph used for both questions above:

 I remember when I first arrived in the United States. Even before the plane landed, the little windows in the airplane revealed snow and ice-covered houses and buildings. As I walked off the plane, cold air crept through the corrugated ramp that led to the airport terminal. Some people inside the airport were wearing big coats and hats, which I had seen on television, but never up close. I felt a little dizzy and needed to sit down, and then my cell phone rang. It was my Aunt Sophia. She was waiting for me outside in the passenger pick-up area, so I walked quickly to the exit, forgetting all about my luggage. When the sliding glass door opened to the outside, there was my aunt‚Äìa woman I hadn‚Äôt seen in over ten years‚Äìwearing a parka and waving her arms frantically in my direction.
